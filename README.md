# **YOLOParkingDetection: Fine-Tuned YOLOv8 for Parking Spot Detection**

YOLOParkingDetection is a deep learning project that uses a **YOLOv8 architecture** to detect parking spot availability in images, classifying each spot as **Empty** or **Occupied**.  
It demonstrates a complete **end-to-end computer vision workflow** including **dataset preparation, EDA, YOLOv8 fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment with Streamlit & Hugging Face**.

## **Dataset**

- **Content**: Parking lot images with bounding boxes for each parking spot  
- **Labels**:  
  - **Empty**  
  - **Occupied**  
- **Preparation**: Data cleaning, annotation, and splitting into train/validation/test sets
